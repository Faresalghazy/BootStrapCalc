<h1 id="bootstrapcalc">BootStrapCalc</h1>
<p>Simple web app as I learn web development with bootstrap.<br>
The app is used to explore basics concepts of HTML and CSS alongside JS and has a focus on minimilistic progressive design.<br>
Best used on a smart phone, try my calculator <a href="https://bss-calc.bss.design/">here</a><br>
